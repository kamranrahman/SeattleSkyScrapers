# SeattleSkyScrapers
Sending Repo to the internet

First off, I want to give credit to Jim Valladingham. I forked his code (https://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_with_d3v4.html) to create this repo and visualization.

Next, I want to provide some background on this visualization.

I was curious as to what the skyscraper landscape has looked for the last several decades in Seattle. 

Since 1911, Seattle has added added 126 skyscrapers and ~3864 ft. in vertical height. Nearly 80% of that growth has taken place since the 1980s. 

So, I decided to visualize this growth in d3. See the data viz live as well. Link below.

When interpreting the viz, note that  node size and color have meaning. 

Size correlates to building height expressed as stories.

Node color indicates property type. Use the legend below. 

Blue = office
Red = residential  
Light Green = hotel
Dark Green = multi-purpose

Note, some multi-purpose buildings could fall into office or residential as well.
